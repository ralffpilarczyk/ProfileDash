# ProfileDash

ProfileDash automatically generates comprehensive company profiles by analyzing uploaded PDF documents using Google Generative AI (Gemini). It provides a simple web interface built with Gradio for easy interaction.

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Leverages Google's Gemini models to analyze content from PDF documents.
*   **Gradio Web Interface:** Simple UI for uploading files and monitoring progress.
*   **Multi-PDF Upload:** Supports uploading multiple PDF documents for analysis.
*   **Email Authentication:** Requires authentication using a company email address (domain restricted) via a code sent using SendGrid.
*   **User-Provided API Key:** Users must provide their own Google AI API key after successful authentication.
*   **Parallel Processing:** Generates different profile sections concurrently for faster results.
*   **Base64 PDF Handling:** Encodes PDFs in base64 for direct processing by the multimodal Gemini API.
*   **Automatic Download:** Automatically triggers the download of the final generated HTML profile upon completion.

## Prerequisites

*   Python (3.10 or newer recommended)
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   Git (for cloning the repository)
*   A SendGrid account with an API key and a verified sender email address.
*   A Google AI (Gemini) API Key.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ProfileDash
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    *   **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        .\.venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration (`.env` File)

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory (`ProfileDash/`) of the project. Add your SendGrid API key to this file:

```dotenv
# .env file
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_actual_sendgrid_api_key_here
```

*   Replace `your_actual_sendgrid_api_key_here` with your key obtained from SendGrid.
*   Ensure you have configured a verified sender email address in your SendGrid account (the application uses `ProfileDash.NoReply@gmail.com` by default, change this in `app.py` if needed, but it must match a verified sender in SendGrid).
*   **Note:** The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is **NOT** configured in the `.env` file; users will enter it via the web interface.

## Running the Application

1.  **Activate your virtual environment** (if you created one).
2.  **Run the Gradio app:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  The application will start, and you will see output in your terminal indicating the local URL, typically:
    `Running on local URL: http://0.0.0.0:7860` or `http://127.0.0.1:7860`.
4.  Open this URL in your web browser.

## Authentication Flow

1.  **Enter Email:** Provide your company email address (must match the `ALLOWED_DOMAIN` set in `app.py`, currently `sc.com`).
2.  **Send Code:** Click "Send Code".
3.  **Receive Code:** Check your email inbox (and spam folder) for a 4-digit authentication code. (If SendGrid is not configured correctly, the app will display a message and allow using the test code `1234`).
4.  **Verify Code:** Enter the received code and click "Verify Code".
5.  **Enter API Key:** Upon successful verification, you will be prompted to enter your Google AI API Key.
    *   You can get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) by signing in, clicking "Get API key", and creating one in a new project. **Copy the key immediately** as it won't be shown again.
6.  **Submit API Key:** Paste your key and click "Submit API Key".

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Upload PDFs:** Once authenticated and the API key is accepted, use the "Upload PDF Documents" area to select the relevant PDF files.
    *   *Desktop:* Hold Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) while clicking to select multiple files.
    *   *Mobile:* Multi-file selection may be limited. Look for a "Select" option within your phone's file browser if available, otherwise you may need to upload sequentially (less ideal) or use a desktop.
2.  **Generate:** Click the "Generate Profile & Download" button.
3.  **Monitor:** Observe the "Status / Log" area and the progress bar for updates. Profile generation can take 10-15 minutes depending on the number/size of documents and API responsiveness.
4.  **Download:** Once processing is complete, your browser should automatically initiate the download of the generated HTML file (e.g., `CompanyName_Profile_Timestamp.html`). Check your browser's downloads.
5.  **Reset:** After a profile is generated (or if you want to start over), click the "Produce New Profile" button to clear the file input and status log for a new run. Your authentication and API key will remain active for the session.

## Known Issues / Future Work

*   Multi-file selection on mobile browsers (especially iOS) is often limited by the operating system.
*   Refinement logic (fact-checking, insight improvement) exists in the codebase but is currently inactive in the Gradio UI. It could be integrated in future versions.
*   Error handling for API issues (rate limits, content blocking) can be further improved with more specific user feedback.
