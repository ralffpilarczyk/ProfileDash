# Analysis specifications
analysis_specs = """
- Base all outputs STRICTLY on the information contained within the provided PDF documents. Do NOT use external knowledge or make assumptions beyond the documents. If information for a requested point is not found, explicitly state that.
- Provide a neutral and unbiased assessment. Critically evaluate information from company-issued documents (like annual reports or investor presentations) which may present a biased view.
- Within each section, prioritize the most important aspects first (e.g., largest business segment, key decision-makers by influence), then proceed in declining order of importance.
- Clearly reference the time period for all data points, either in table headers (e.g., "Revenue (FY2023)") or in parentheses immediately following the data point (e.g., "$100M (2023)").
- If you calculate data (e.g., EBITDA Margin = EBITDA / Revenues), clearly label it with "(calc)" (e.g., "EBITDA Margin (calc)").
- Use footnotes ONLY for direct, verbatim quotes or tables from the source documents. Indicate the quote clearly (e.g., using blockquote or quotation marks) and provide a concise reference (e.g., "Source: DocName, Page X"). Do NOT footnote general statements or summaries or inferences.
- Present financial data consistently. If EBITDA is not directly provided, calculate it as Operating Profit + Depreciation and Amortization, labeling it appropriately (e.g., "EBITDA (calc)").
- Focus on the most recent financial periods and forward-looking statements or projections, as these are typically most relevant.
- For example, the most recent annual report is important, but the subsequent interim reports are even more important.
- Adopt a highly analytical, concise, and fact-oriented writing style. Avoid jargon and abbreviations where possible, but use precise business terms where necessary.
- Generate insightful analysis that goes beyond simple data extraction. Highlight non-obvious connections, implications, or potential risks/opportunities derived *logically* from the provided facts. Briefly explain the reasoning for these insights.
- Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Factual Accuracy & Document Grounding: Is information correct AND directly supported by the provided documents?
    2. Completeness: Does the section address its specific instructions, considering all relevant document information?
    3. Insightfulness: Does it offer meaningful, non-obvious observations derived logically from the documents?
    4. Conciseness: Is it free of redundancy, speculation, and unnecessary elaboration?
    5. Coherence & Structure: Is it well-organized, logically flowing, and easy to understand?

# Output format
output_format = """
Use HTML formatting STRICTLY as follows:

<format_instructions>

1.  **Main Section Wrapper:**
    *   EVERY section's entire output MUST start exactly with `<div class="section" id="section-{section_number}">` (replace `{section_number}` with the actual number).
    *   EVERY section's entire output MUST end exactly with `</div>`. No characters or whitespace should follow the final closing div tag.

2.  **Section Header:**
    *   Immediately after the opening `div` tag, include the section header: `<h2>{section_number}. {section_title}</h2>` (replace variables).

3.  **Content Structure:**
    *   Use `<p>` tags for paragraphs.
    *   Use `<h3>`, `<h4>`, etc., for subsections IF appropriate for structure, nested correctly within the main `div`.
    *   Use `<ul>` or `<ol>` for lists, with `<li>` for each item. All `<li>` tags MUST be inside a `<ul>` or `<ol>`.
    *   Use `<strong>` for emphasis where appropriate, do NOT use `<b>`.
    *   Use `<br/>` for single line breaks (ensure self-closing).

4.  **Tables:**
    *   Use this EXACT structure for all tables:
        ```html
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Header 1 (Unit/Year)</th>
              <th>Header 2 (Unit/Year)</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Data A1</td>
              <td>Data A2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Data B1</td>
              <td>Data B2</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        ```
    *   Tables MUST have `<thead>` and `<tbody>`.
    *   Header cells MUST use `<th>` within `<thead>`.
    *   Data cells MUST use `<td>` within `<tbody>`.
    *   All `<td>` or `<th>` MUST be inside a `<tr>`.
    *   All `<tr>` MUST be inside `<thead>` or `<tbody>`.

5.  **Quotes (Use Sparingly):**
    *   For short, direct quotes: `"Verbatim quote text [Source: DocName, Page X]."`.
    *   For longer quotes: `<blockquote>Verbatim quote text.<cite>[Source: DocName, Page X]</cite></blockquote>`.

6.  **CRITICAL HTML RULES:**
    *   **Validity:** Produce valid HTML. Every opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag (except self-closing like `<br/>`).
    *   **Nesting:** Tags must be properly nested (e.g., `<p><strong>text</strong></p>` is correct, `<p><strong>text</p></strong>` is incorrect).
    *   **No Markdown:** Do NOT use Markdown syntax (like `*`, `#`, `[]()`). Only use the specified HTML tags.
    *   **No ```:** Do NOT include ```html or ``` anywhere in the output.
